precis <- "I have included a copy of a .csv that enumerates the admissions data for UC Berkeley, divided up by ethnicity and race. I would love to analyze how these statistics have changed with the enactment of law 209 that eliminated race-consciousness in admissions. After analyzing these trends I would like to see if there are other programs that Berkeley has to encourage diversity even if the admissions process is race-blind."
